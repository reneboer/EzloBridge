# EzloBridge
A bridge running on openLuup to make the Ezlo controled devices availble on openLuup with all its great plugins.

This version is early Beta.


To-do's:
- Reconnecting is not working without restarting openLuup.
- Need better login error handling.
- Add Refresh command to pull full config from Ezlo hub again.

Note: For Ezlo Linux hub the certificates are not pulled from the Ezlo servers yet and you must update these manually. Not a simple process.
